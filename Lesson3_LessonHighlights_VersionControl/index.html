            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Version control is a system that saves a copy of every change made to a file. This is commonly used for files like software updates, although this can be used for just about any file on a computer. This can, of course, be done manually by copying files into a separate directory. However, this method has its disadvantages. For instance, it is easy to accidently write to the wrong version of the file or even copy over file versions. There are many different types of version control systems which have evolved over time to meet the standards of todayâ€™s computers.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">One of the more popular types of version control system is RCS, which stands for revision control system. RCS works by keeping patch sets in a special format. These patch sets can rebuild a file to look exactly the way it did at any point. This is done by adding up all the patches. RCS is actually offered on Mac OS when you download the developer tools. The main disadvantage of this type of VCS is that it is local. This means you can only access the patch sets on the same computer you originally saved it on. This is not ideal when trying to work in teams or away from your local computer.

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">CVCS, which stands for centralized version control system, addresses the disadvantage that many other version control systems present. The disadvantage that is addressed is not being able to collaborate on files because of a local version control system. A centralized version control system is a very efficient way to handle multiple versions of different files for a large group or company. This is done by storing all of the versioned files on one single, central server. Using this system, everyone, with the correct permissions, has access to the files. This ensures that everyone in the group is editing and viewing the same exact information.

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">DVCS, which stands for distributed version control system, is the best version control system. It combines all of the advantages seen in other types of version control systems. This system mirrors the entire repository which contains all of the versioned files. The advantage of this system over the rest is that your files are actually backed up. With a centralized version control system, everything is stored in one place, which means if this server fails, you have no way of restoring those versioned files. With this system, you can also work with several different remote repositories instead of just one. This way, you can work with multiple groups in the same project.

                <span class="text-muted">Advantages of VCS
</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">There are several advantages of using a version control system. The biggest advantage of VCS is being able to revert to an older version of a file if something goes wrong. Another big advantage is the ability to compare different file versions to see what exactly has changed over time. This can be especially important if you are working on a file with a team. This way, all changes are recorded, and the person who made the change is also recorded. Version control systems should be used by every developer. It is the most efficient way to manage and store files of a lengthy and important project. I would say that web developers should especially use VCS so they can see how the site used to look and how it has evolved over time.
